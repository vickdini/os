# Virtual Memory & Paging Documentation

- **Subsystem**: Memory Management (Virtual Layer & Hardware MMU)

## 1. Conceptual Overview

Modern 64-bit CPUs do not let user programs or high-level kernel functions read and write directly to physical RAM chips. Instead, they use **Virtual Memory**.

Every address a program interacts with is a **Virtual Address**. The hardware Memory Management Unit (MMU) consults a multi-level tree of translation tables (called **Page Tables**) to convert that virtual address into a **Physical Address** in RAM.

### Benefits of Paging
1. **Isolation**: Process A and Process B can both have code at virtual address `0x400000`, but they map to completely different physical RAM chips.
2. **Protection**: Pages can be marked read-only, non-executable (NX/XD bit to prevent malware buffer-overflow attacks), or kernel-only.
3. **Continuity**: Large buffers appear contiguous in virtual memory even if physical frames are scattered across RAM.

## 2. 4-Level Paging Architecture (x86_64)

In 64-bit x86 architecture, translating a 48-bit canonical virtual address uses a 4-level tree:

```
Virtual Address:
[ PML4 Index (9 bits) | PDPT Index (9 bits) | PD Index (9 bits) | PT Index (9 bits) | Offset (12 bits) ]
        |                      |                     |                  |                     |
        v                      v                     v                  v                     v
   [ CR3 Register ]
        |
        +---> PML4 Table (Level 4)
                  |
                  +---> PDPT Table (Level 3 - Page Directory Pointer Table)
                            |
                            +---> PD Table (Level 2 - Page Directory)
                                      |
                                      +---> PT Table (Level 1 - Page Table)
                                                |
                                                +---> Physical Frame (4 KiB) + Offset
```

- **CR3**: The CPU control register holding the physical address of the active Level 4 (PML4) table.

## 3. The `AddressSpace` Struct

```rust
pub struct AddressSpace {
    pml4_phys: PhysAddr,
}
```

Represents a virtual memory context anchored by its PML4 root table.

## 4. API Reference & Methods

| Method | Signature | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `active()` | `fn() -> Self` | Attaches to the active address space by reading `CR3`. |
| `from_pml4()` | `const fn(PhysAddr) -> Self` | Creates an address space handle for a given root PML4 table. |
| `switch()` | `unsafe fn(&self)` | Reloads the CPU's `CR3` register with this address space's PML4 root. |
| `translate_addr()` | `unsafe fn(&self, VirtAddr) -> Option<PhysAddr>` | Walks PML4 hierarchy to translate any virtual address to its physical address. |
| `translate_page()` | `unsafe fn(&self, Page) -> Option<(PhysFrame, PageTableFlags)>` | Queries mapped frame and protection flags (`PRESENT`, `WRITABLE`, `USER`, `NX`). |
| `map_page()` | `unsafe fn(&mut self, Page, PhysFrame, PageTableFlags, &mut PhysicalMemoryManager) -> Result<(), &'static str>` | Allocates missing intermediate tables (PDPT, PD, PT) on demand, maps a 4 KiB page, and flushes the TLB. |
| `unmap_page()` | `unsafe fn(&mut self, Page) -> Result<PhysFrame, &'static str>` | Clears the page table entry, flushes the TLB via `invlpg`, and returns the previously mapped frame. |
| `update_flags()` | `unsafe fn(&mut self, Page, PageTableFlags) -> Result<(), &'static str>` | Updates protection bits for an existing mapped page and invalidates TLB. |
| `identity_map()` | `unsafe fn(&mut self, PhysFrame, PageTableFlags, &mut PhysicalMemoryManager) -> Result<(), &'static str>` | Maps a physical frame 1:1 (`virt = phys`), essential for MMIO (APIC, GOP framebuffer). |
| `map_range()` | `unsafe fn(&mut self, Page, PhysFrame, usize, PageTableFlags, &mut PhysicalMemoryManager) -> Result<(), &'static str>` | Maps a contiguous sequence of virtual pages to physical frames. |
| `create_user_space()`| `fn(&mut PhysicalMemoryManager) -> Result<Self, &'static str>` | Allocates a new PML4 table, mirrors higher-half kernel entries, and leaves lower-half empty for isolated Ring 3 user tasks. |

## 5. Interactive Shell Commands

Hydra provides built-in commands to inspect and modify virtual memory mappings dynamically:

```text
hydra> translate 0x400000
4-Level PML4 Page Table Walk for 0x400000:
  PML4 Index (L4):    0
  PDPT Index (L3):    0
  PD Index   (L2):    2
  PT Index   (L1):    0
  Page Offset:        0x0
  Status:             MAPPED
  Physical Target:    0x400000
  Base Frame:         0x400000
  Protection Flags:   [PRESENT] [WRITABLE] [SUPERVISOR/RING-0] [EXECUTABLE]

hydra> map 0x7000000000 0x1000000 rw
[+] Successfully mapped Page 0x7000000000 -> Frame 0x1000000 (flags: PageTableFlags(PRESENT | WRITABLE))

hydra> unmap 0x7000000000
[+] Successfully unmapped Page 0x7000000000 (previously mapped to Frame 0x1000000)
```
